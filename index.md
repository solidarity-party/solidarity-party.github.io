* **[STV](stv)** - This is a program built by Desmond Silveira for tallying [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) (STV) ballots.  If a file in the [BLT format](https://code.google.com/archive/p/droop/wikis/BltFileFormat.wiki) (first described by Hill, Wichmann & Woodall in *[Algorithm 123 - Single Transferable Vote by Meek's method](http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.NSF/Files/meekm/$file/meekm.pdf)* and popularized by [OpaVote](https://www.opavote.com/)) is uploaded, a tally is generated.
